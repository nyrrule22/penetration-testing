## Exploitation Checks

* [ ] Enumerate and download any interesting files ideally looking for credentials or other information relating to other services.
* [ ] Can you login via FTP and put files on the system?
  * [ ] If so, is there a web interface where you can access the files?
    * [ ] If so, then you may be able to upload a reverse shell.
