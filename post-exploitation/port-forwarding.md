# Port Forwarding

## Examples

### SSH Tunneling

#### Local Port Forwarding

Scenario: When getting a foothold on a target machine, you find a service running on that machine only listening on local host, so you want to forward it to the Attack machine so you can access it.

```bash
# From Kali (Attack Machine)
# Syntax
ssh -L <local port>:<localhost>:<target port> -l <target user> <target IP>
# Example (from the Pandora machine on HTB)
ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80 -l daniel 10.129.250.50
```
