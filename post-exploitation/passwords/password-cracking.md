### Crackstation

### Crunch

Crunch can create a wordlist based on criteria you specify. The output from crunch can be sent to the screen, file, or to another program.

```bash
crunch 10 10 -t password%%  # Generates list of 10 characters ending in 00-99
password00
...
password99

crunch 6 6 -t pass@@ -o pass.txt  # Generates list of 6 characters ending in aa-zz
passaa
...
passzz
```

### RSMangler

RSMangler will take a wordlist and perform various manipulations on it similar to those done by John the Ripper with a few extras.

```bash
rsmangler
```

### CeWL

CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a ruby app which spiders a given URL, up to a specified depth, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper. Optionally, CeWL can follow external links.

CeWL can also create a list of email addresses found in mailto links. These email addresses can be used as usernames in brute force actions.

```bash
cewl <ip> -w meta.txt -d 3
```

### JohnTheRipper

```bash
john linhash.txt --worlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
john --show linhash.txt  # Show already cracked passwords for specific hashes
```
